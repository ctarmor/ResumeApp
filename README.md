# Carlos A Resume React Based App

## Welcome to my resume written entirely in React/Typescript.  


There is not much to a resume, so I over engineered the application a bit to show different patterns, state management and techniques.

The application is built using the following packages and patterns:

### [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/)

### [React Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)

### [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

### [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/basic)

### [React Functional Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

### [Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)

### [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

### [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview)



## Cloudfront AWS App

The application is hosted by AWS Cloudfront within a S3 static bucket.
